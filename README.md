# FreeMyXe

by Emma / InvoxiPlayGames

Xbox 360 executable designed to apply freedom-unlocking patches to the kernel
and hypervisor.

For use with [Xbox360BadUpdate](https://github.com/grimdoomer/Xbox360BadUpdate).

Nowhere near finished or ready or stable or anything. Currently patches some
XEX load checks as well as LIVE/PIRS signature verification in the kernel.

## TODO

* Userland memory protection patches
* Actual patch compiler and loader
* Daaaashlaaaaaaunch?
